# Sow and Reap
Sow and Reap adds a new weapon type to Caves of Qud: the **Scythe** â€” a humble farming implement, now wielded as a weapon of war.

## Features
ðŸŒ¿ 18 new weapons: 9 scythes (two-handed) and 9 sickles (one-handed).

ðŸŒ¿ New Scythe skill tree

ðŸŒ¿ New "Ready For Harvest" status effect

ðŸŒ¿ New mutant calling, Harvester

## Scythes & Sickles
ðŸŒ¿ Critical effect: Knocks target prone

ðŸŒ¿ Damage progression is similar to Long Blades

ðŸŒ¿ Full tier progression available (bronze - zetachrome)

ðŸŒ¿ Scythes and sickles can appear as relics

ðŸŒ¿ Unlike other weapon types, the two-handed version of the weapon is more likely to spawn than the one-handed version

## Scythe Skills
Explore a fully-featured skill tree to master the scythe's fickle crescent blade. Apply the Ready For Harvest status effect with your basic scythe attacks, then exploit it to power up your active abilities.

### Passive Skills
ðŸŒ± Scythe Expertise: +2 to hit with scythes and a 15% chance to apply Ready For Harvest on hit.

ðŸŒ¿ Sow: Gain an extra +2 to hit plants and fungi, increase your chance to apply Ready For Harvest to 30%, and (Harvestry required) gain an extra crop when harvesting rare plants.

### Active Skills
ðŸª“ Cut Down: Attack and dismember your target's legs (inflicting bleed) on a penetrating hit. Consumes Ready For Harvest to cut off another mobility limb and inflict even more bleeding.

âš¡Vaulting Strike: Leap past an opponent and land in the space behind them, attacking them on the way. Consumes Ready For Harvest to bamboozle them, knocking them prone and inflicting confusion.

ðŸŒ™ Harvest Moon: Make a sweeping attack against 3 adjacent spaces at once. Consumes Ready For Harvest to deal double damage.

ðŸŒ€ Swhirlwind: Swipe your scythe through the air, gathering up adjacent gasses and dumping them all on your target's space. Inflicts Ready For Harvest if they don't already have it.

## Wishes
* Spawn any scythe with "SowReap_Scythe" + the tier number (e.g., SowReap_Scythe2 for steel) or leave the number off for bronze (tier 0).
* Spawn any sickle with "SowReap_Sickle" + the tier number

## Planned Features
* Unique art for all the skills and abilities
* Unique scythe variants
* New quest to acquire a powerful legendary scythe
* Better integration into the game's economy, quest rewards, and enemy inventories
* New sound effects
* Enemy AI support for scythe skills
